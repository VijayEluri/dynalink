/**
 * A linker for POJOs. Normally used as the ultimate fallback linker by the {@link DynamicLinkerFactory} so it is given
 * the chance to link calls to all objects that no other language runtime recognizes. Specifically, this linker will:
 * <ul>
 * <li>expose all public methods of form {@code setXxx()}, {@code getXxx()}, and {@code isXxx()} as property setters and
 * getters for {@code dyn:setProp} and {@code dyn:getProp} operations;</li>
 * <li>expose all property getters and setters declared by the class' {@link BeanInfo};</li>
 * <li>expose all public methods and methods declared by the class' {@link BeanInfo} for invocation through
 * {@code dyn:callMethod} operation;</li>
 * <li>expose all public methods and methods declared by the class' {@link BeanInfo} for retrieval for
 * {@code dyn:getMethod} operation; the methods thus retrieved can then be invoked using {@code dyn:call};</li>
 * <li>expose all public fields as properties, unless there are getters or setters for the properties of the same name;</li>
 * <li>expose {@code dyn:getLength}, {@code dyn:getElem} and {@code dyn:setElem} on native Java arrays, as well as
 * {@link java.util.List} and {@link java.util.Map} objects; ({@code dyn:getLength} works on any
 * {@link java.util.Collection});</li>
 * <li>expose a virtual property named {@code length} on Java arrays;</li>
 * <li>expose {@code dyn:new} on instances of {@link StaticClass} as calls to constructors, including those static class
 * objects that represent Java arrays (their constructors take a single {@code int} parameter representing the length of
 * the array to create);</li>
 * <li>expose static methods, fields, and properties of classes in a similar manner to how instance method, fields, and
 * properties are exposed, on {@link StaticClass} objects.</li>
 * <li>expose a virtual property named {@code static} on instances of {@link java.lang.Class} to access their
 * {@link StaticClass}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p><strong>Overloaded method resolution</strong> is performed automatically for property setters, methods, and
 * constructors. Additionally, manual overloaded method selection is supported by having a call site specify a name for
 * a method that contains an explicit signature, i.e. {@code dyn:getMethod:parseInt(String,int)}. You can use
 * non-qualified class names in such signatures regardless of those classes' packages, they will match any class with
 * the same non-qualified name. You only have to use a fully qualified class name in case non-qualified class names
 * would cause selection ambiguity (that is extremely rare).</p>
 * <p><strong>Variable argument invocation</strong> is handled for both methods and constructors.</p>
 * <p>Currently, only public fields and methods are supported. Any Lookup objects passed in the
 * {@link LinkRequest}s are ignored and {@link MethodHandles#publicLookup()} is used instead.</p>
